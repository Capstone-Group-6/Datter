#Sessions Policy: Behavior Overview-
#Action: user logs in to Datter on machine A
#Result: session-token is created in server,
#        session-token and _id(user-obj-id) are inserted in to
#        sessions_collection.
#
#sessions_collection maintains account of logged in user for duration of session.
#
#Action: user logs in to Datter on machine B
#Result: session-token in sessions_collection from machine A is overridden,
#        by newly created session-token from login on machine B. 
#
#Action: user logs out
#Result: session key-token, _id(user-obj-id) document is removed from 
#        sessions_collection.
